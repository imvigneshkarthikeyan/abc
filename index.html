                    <p>Kaali (Rajinikanth) is an elderly man who takes up a job as a boys hostel warden at a college in Darjeeling. When he first comes to the hostel, he notices it being dominated by a group of rowdy final-year students led by Michael (Bobby Simha), the son of a local leader named Gnanam (Aadukalam Naren). Kaali manages to put a full stop to Michael's antics, which leads to enmity between the two. Kaali forms a close bond with an NRI hostelite named Anwar (Sananth Reddy), who is in a romantic relationship with Anu (Megha Akash), the daughter of a pranic healer, Mangalam (Simran). When Kaali meets Mangalam to convince her to accept her daughter's relationship with Anwar, they both fall in love.</p>
                    <p>In Uttar Pradesh, Petta and Anwar come into confrontation with Jithu, who is determined to kill them both after he also learned about the animosity between Petta and his father. They manage to escape from him. Later, Petta meets Jithu privately and tells him that he is none other than his son Chinna, who did not die in the bomb blast, but was adopted by Singaar after finding out that he was still alive. When Jithu confronts Singaar regarding his parentage, the latter sends his men to kill Jithu, who is rescued by Petta. Along with Anwar and Michael's henchmen, Petta and Jithu then barge into Singaar's mansion and kill him and his henchmen.Following Singaar's death, Petta has a surprise in store for Jithu. He reveals that Jithu is not his son and that he really is Singaar's son. He used him to lead him to Singaar as part of a strategy to kill the latter. He further adds that Chinna had died in the bomb blast 20 years ago and that the men he sent to kill Jithu were his own and not Singaar's. He then tells Jithu that he will either kill him or leave him alive. After some time, the screen turns black and a gunshot is heard.</p>
